# MARISSA - Magnetic Resonance Imaging Software for Standardization

## Preparation
In order to use the MARISSA software please install the software according to the provided MARISSA_User_Manual.pdf

## Information
MARISSA is a software to enable the post-hoc standardization of quantitative measurements in magnetic resonance imaging. The current version was tested
as a first proof-of-concept on native, midventricular parametric T1 maps in cardiovascular manetic resonance imaging. Its application on
other quantification methods, such as parametric T2 mapping, or tissues, i.e. the liver, is not limited, but yet not tested.

## Usage
After installation according to the user manual, the MARISSA_start.bat or MARISSA_start.sh can be used to start the program (tested on Windows 11 only)

## Scripts
In the publication, the training and plots were performed with scripts that can be found in marissa\scripts.
Its usage require adaption to the own training dataset. The import of the data and segmentation as well as the definition of confounding parameters were done via the graphical user interface.
